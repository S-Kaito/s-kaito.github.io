			<h2>
				What is DeepLearning?
			</h2>
			<div>
				&nbsp;DeepLearning is one of AI(Artifical Intelligence). It is imitated brains of living beings. Brains of living beings is made up a lot of a group of neuron. When neuron receive eloctronic signals, the neuron give electronic signals to another neuron. This mechanism is used in the brain.
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;DeepLearning can be implemented to reproduce neuron's mecanism.
			</div>
			<h2>
				What is neuron?
			</h2>
			<div>
				&nbsp;We can't talk about DeepLearning without neuron. But neuron's nechanism is simple. Look at Figure01.
			</div>

				<div><b>Figure01</b></div>
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;If neuron receive electronic signals to another neuron above the standard, the neuron will be excitement and give electronic signals another neuron. But each neuron has difficult standard. 
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="Figure02.png" style="border: #000000 solid 2px;">
				<div><b>Figure02</b></div>
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;Figure02 is the formura which neuron received electronic signals. "w" is weight (in other words is value). It means strength of neuron-to-neuron relationship. Neurons are not always friends as neurons are not as good friends as all people are. So, "x" which receive electronic signal other neuron is multipled "w".
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;It is added "b" too. Neuron's excitement are disjoined. So the formula has to conform it. And Figure03 is formula all of electronic signals it received.
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="Figure03.png" style="border: #000000 solid 2px;">
				<div><b>Figure03</b></div>
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;Neuron's feature is descripted the above. The next work is express neuron's excitement from total of electronic signals. I'll show you graphs which types of excitementof neuron.
			</div>
			<div class="image">
				<img src="Figure04.png" style="border: #000000 solid 2px;">
				<div><b>Figure04</b></div>
			</div>
				&nbsp;Look at Figure04. This function's name is "Sigmoid function". There is feature which solution can fit 0 to 1. In addtion, differential of this function is easy to handle. For that reason, it is used on Neural Network since ancient times.
			<div class="image">
				<img src="Figure05.png" style="border: #000000 solid 2px;">
				<div><b>Figure05</b></div>
			</div>
				&nbsp;Look at Figure05. This function's name is "ReLU"
			<div class="image">
				<img src="Figure06.png" style="border: #000000 solid 2px;">
				<div><b>Figure06</b></div>

			<h2>
				Network of neuron
			</h2>
			<div>
				&nbsp;Imagine if you connect many neuron. Neurons can send many information as electronic signals. And can calcuate advance calcuation as possible as image proccesing.
